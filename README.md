# piCoreGamePlayer
Modifications, patches and extensions to change piCorePlayer to a retro gaming station

## Abstract idea
I build a standard piCorePlayer box and added nice box, cover and sound environment in the kitchen area. After some time I setup a RetroPie in the living room. Then I just had the idea if I'm able to combine my piCorePlayer and retro gaming in the same place. Here is the result.
