# piCoreGamePlayer
Modifications, patches and extensions to change piCorePlayer to a retro gaming station

## Abstract idea
I build a standard piCorePlayer box and added nice box, cover and sound environment in the kitchen area. After some time I setup a RetroPie in the living room. Then I just had the idea if I'm able to combine my piCorePlayer and retro gaming in the same place. Here is the result.

## High Level Design
Blocks to be used in the current architecture:
1) piCorePlayer 6.0.0
2) JiveLite
3) SDL1.2
4) VICE 3.4

## Dependencies from piCorePlayer
- rpi-vc
- rpi-vc-dev
- libpng
- libpng-dev
- readline-dev
- automake (to regenerate Makefiles after disabling VICE doc folder)
- autoconf (to regenerate Makefiles after disabling VICE doc folder)
- libasound
- libasound-dev

## Dependencies to build VICE
(Hint: If you don't like to build on your own find some prebuild tcz in the release section in GitHub)
- xa
  - Get the source from here: http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/
  - I used xa-2.3.11 for this PoC.
  - Call 'make' to run the Makefile to start the build process
  - Follow the Tiny Core instructions[1] to build/install a xa.tcz package
  - You need xa only to compile VICE not to run it. So no need to install xa.tcz in onboot.lst or ignore it complete if you just install SDL and VICE binaries.
- SDL1.2
  - Get a RPI version from here: https://github.com/vanfanel/SDL-1.2.15-raspberrypi
  - Apply the patch in this GitHub project (patches/SDL-1.2.15.patch) to SDL source
  - Call './MAC_ConfigureSDL12-rpi2.sh && make' to start the build process
  - follow the Tiny Core instructions[1] to build/install a SDL.tcz package 
- VICE
  - Get the source from here: https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/index.html#download
  - I used vice-3.4 for this PoC.
  - Apply the patch in this GitHub project (patches/vice-3.4.patch) to SDL source
  - depending on your free RAM ad SWAP you might have to add a swap partition. Otherwise the VICE build may break with a compiler error. After I added and activated 2GB it worked perfect. Please search and read Tiny Core documentation how to do this.
  - Call './configure --enable-x64 --enable-sdlui --disable-sdlui2 --disable-hwscale && make' to start the build process
  - follow the Tiny Core instructions[1] to build/install a vice.tcz package 
  
## Run C64 games with VICE
For the current state of development in this PoC I kill the JiveLite process (if running) to have full SDL framebuffer access. I'll write some more words in chapter below. Just to demonstrate the PoC do:
- ps -A | grep jivelite
- You'll find the jivelite process, the starter script and the grep call itself. Kill the first two.
- kill \<pid\>
- Copy a C64 ROM (for sure one you ripped before from you own original buyed games...) to a folder on your RPI
- sudo SDL1_VIDEODRIVER="fbcon" x64 +truedrive <ROM.d64>

## Jive Applet
Find in folder jive-applet/GamePlayer an example applet how a Jive Applet could be started. The current applet design quits JiveLite and returns a handler integer to a modified JiveLite start script. This starts then VICE with a specific game loaded. Next startup it returns to JiveLite.

## Open topics / design challenges
A collection of some raw design ideas and challenges I had while developing that PoC:
- SDL2 for piCorePlayer as base for VICE
  - Might have better hardware support
  - I get managed to compile SDL2, but failed to run any demo applications because it wasn't able to find a display. Don't remember the exact error message
  - Might conflict with a running JiveLite that is compiled against SDL1.2
  - Maybe it's possible to compile also JiveLite against SDL2
- Conflict runnning JiveLite and VICE on the same SDL framebuffer
  - To check if this problem would also exist with SDL2
  - It's possible to run two SDL application at the same time, but only the first one started get's keyboard control (see SDL-1.2.15.patch: for ( i = 0; i<nread; ++i)...). So if I run VICE without killing JiveLite before I couldn't use keyboard input (only virtual VICE keyboard).
  - One possible design to solve the keyboard problem would be to write a minimal "window manager" SDL application which starts before JiveLite, grabs the keyboard input and distribute keys (either in a specific mainloop) or any virtual tty approach to the application which has focus (VICE or JiveLite).
  - A possible keyboard workaround could to close/kill JiveLite before I run VICE and start it again afterwards. But only as workaround a good design needs to be created. (see example in jivelite.sh + the Jive Applet example)
  - Depending on further experiments I'll choose for one of those ways or decide for another base architecture (wayland, SDL2, DirectFB,...)
  - Even better idea is to use https://www.libretro.com/index.php/api/ with https://github.com/libretro/vice-libretro which offers a on-screen keyboard. I've to see if this compiles out-of-the-box on piCorePlayer and SDL1.2.
- Other Emulators could be supported (NES,...)
- Develop a JiveLite Applet to run a emulation selector menu and write a LMS plugin that reads gamegui.xml from RetroPie/EmulationStation installation on the server Raspberry. The server could provide ROMs then on the fly on request.
